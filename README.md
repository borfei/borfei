This is my **GitHub account**, which I use to put my personal projects.

For my projects that are made for educational purpose, I put them in my [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/borfei)
instead. I've designed it this way so that it is organized enough for my repositories to put in.

If you want to contact me, just send me via email: [borfei@proton.me](mailto:borfei@proton.me)
